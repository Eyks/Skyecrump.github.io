<p> <div> Hi guys, this is my simple webpage. I grew up in Kennebunkport, Maine, and I've lived in NYC previously. Now,
I go to school here in Orono. </div> I began as a CS Major, but quickly found out it wasn't the path for me, so I switched to
Economics. <div>Along the way, I picked up Accounting and decided I would like to become a CPA.</div></p>
